### Hi there 👋, I am @Ngan

As an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test), I currently work for some and past client on Upwork to involve a combination of software development and testing activities specific to the client's project.

🎖️ Credibility

As an experienced test engineer who is well-trained and certified by ISQTB [ isqtb.org ], I'm familiar and proficient with most of the skills and tools needed in the testing industry. 

I'm also a certified Atlassian engineer, specializing in configuring Jira settings and configuration that perfectly meets with QA processes. If your team also uses Jira as the project management tool, I can help to recommend best practices and guidelines provided by Atlassian.

🎖️ [ myup.work/nganntk-acp-610 ] ■ Certified Jira Data Center Project Admin

🎖️ [ myup.work/nganntk-acp-620 ] ■ Certified Jira Cloud Project Admin

Here are a few ideas I believe I can add value as a SDET:
- Develop a modern QA strategy focused on automation first and CI/CD testing in alignment with management expectations
- Contribute to the development and DevOps CI/CD strategy with practical experience in automated test design patterns
- Develop and maintain test scripts and frameworks that are automatically invoked by CI/CD system, covering UI testing, regression testing, smoke testing, integration testing
- Identify trends and effectiveness of test suites to determine between automation versus manual testing
